# FinalProject

Final project for Biomedical Imaging & Analytics and Deep Learning courses (Skoltech, 2022).

## Abstract

Science in medicine is evolving rapidly, not only in the direction of new approaches or
algorithms, but also in the direction of medical devices. One of the hot issues that have been
raised is the problem of domain adaptation. Algorithms trained on old devices do not show
good results on new ones, due to differences between the domains. The solution to this
problem in the minds of scientists is not only in the medical field, but most approaches are
not applicable in this area. This paper shows, that the style can be transferred using Image-to-Image translation and Transfer Learning. The aim of the project is to review current methods for Image-to-Image Translation and compare its results with Transfer Learning. As a result we show that Image-to-Image Translation is better for domain adaption than Transfer Learning with small amount of labeled data.
